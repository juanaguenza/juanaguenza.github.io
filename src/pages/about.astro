I am currently working on the <a href="https://x.company/blog/posts/introducing-chorus/" target="_blank">Chorus</a> project at X, the Moonshot Factory (formerly known as Google X) as a QA and Solutions Engineer. I am interested in building new things and solving real world problems with innovative solutions :)
