I used to shoot Fujifilm but then I switched to shooting Sony and I've been
in this dilemma of editing RAWs or just using jpegs. Nothing seems to replicate
the look of Fujifilm recipes especially with their Film Simulations - but I've
been messing around with Sony's Creative Looks and they have been doing a great
job to replicate the feeling.

I wonder why I switched to Sony if I was only
going to chase after trying to recreate the look Fujifilm would
produce SOOC - so I started to test out editing RAWs, after all most pictures
that are posted online and win awards are edited RAWs.

Enjoy some pictures of Battery Spencer and the Golden Gate Bridge :)
